Software Project : Asset-Liability Management and Interest Rate Risk 

*Project Overview :*

The ALM - RTIG software is a tool designed to assist financial professionals in managing interest rate risk and asset-liability management (ALM). This desktop application provides a comprehensive analysis of financial risk, with functionalities to calculate various metrics related to interest rate gaps, net interest margin (NIM) impacts, net present value (NPV) under shock scenarios, and Value at Risk (VaR) for portfolios. The tool enables users to simulate changes in interest rates, view graphical data, and export results for further analysis.

*Key Features :*

  - Rate Gap Analysis: Calculates and visualizes annual rate gaps between assets (e.g., loans) and liabilities (e.g., deposits), providing insights into portfolio sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations.
  - Neutral Hedge Analysis: Assesses the effectiveness of interest rate swaps in mitigating risk, allowing portfolio managers to optimize hedging strategies.
  - Net Interest Margin Impact: Calculates potential impacts on NIM due to changes in interest rates, enabling better profitability management.
  - Net Present Value (NPV) under Shocks: Simulates various shock scenarios (e.g., parallel shifts, steepening, flattening of the yield curve) to assess portfolio sensitivity.
  - 99% Value at Risk (VaR): Calculates VaR to quantify the maximum expected portfolio loss under adverse interest rate movements with a 99% confidence level.

*Interface Overview :*

Upon launching the software, an interactive graphical interface opens with buttons representing the toolâ€™s functionalities:

  - Load Excel File: Load the financial data file (base_de_donnees.xlsx).
  - Rate Gap Calculations: Performs rate gap analysis with or without hedging.
  - NIM Impact Calculation: Estimates the effect of interest rate changes on net interest margin.
  - NPV Shock Analysis: Calculates net present value under various interest rate shock scenarios.
  - VaR Calculation: Computes Value at Risk for the portfolio.
  - Export Results to Excel: Saves calculation results to an Excel file for further review.
